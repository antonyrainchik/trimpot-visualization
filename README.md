# trimpot-visualization
A little winter break project as a way to practice and learn C, using OpenGL, GLUT, and pthread combined with Arduino serial reading and a tiny potentiometer to create cheap real time visualization from analog data.
The OpenGL aspect of this code was inspired by https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/openglexamples/ so thanks to them
